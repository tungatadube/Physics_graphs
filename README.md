Graphs for physics plots. 
I made these plots to fill the demand for quick modifiable charts in my content development work.
The scripts plot deffirent charts which include line graphs, scatter graphs, bar graphs as well as pie charts for notes, exercises and tests in High school physics. I am currently working on perfecting my Django skills such that I willl make a web application that will feature the scripts and allow pupils to learn how to present data using charts. Currently I am using the scripts to produce snipped static images that I use in the development of the static images for my content.
